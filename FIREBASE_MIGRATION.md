# Firebase Migration Complete

## Overview
The application has been completely migrated from Supabase to Firebase. All authentication, database operations, and real-time features now use Firebase services.

## What Changed

### 1. Authentication
- Replaced Supabase Auth with Firebase Authentication
- Updated all auth contexts and hooks
- Maintained same user roles system (admin, agent, customer)

### 2. Database
- Migrated from PostgreSQL (Supabase) to Firestore (Firebase)
- Converted relational data structure to document-based collections
- Updated all CRUD operations to use Firestore

### 3. Real-time Features
- Replaced Supabase real-time subscriptions with Firestore real-time listeners
- Updated chat functionality to use Firebase real-time updates
- Maintained ticket status updates and notifications

### 4. Collections Structure
```
users/
  - id (document ID = Firebase Auth UID)
  - name, email, role, createdAt, updatedAt, etc.

tickets/
  - id (auto-generated)
  - title, description, status, priority, category
  - customerId, assignedTo, createdAt, updatedAt

chatRooms/
  - id (auto-generated)
  - customerId, agentId, ticketId, status
  - createdAt, updatedAt

chatMessages/
  - id (auto-generated)
  - chatRoomId, senderId, message, ticketId
  - createdAt

activities/
  - id (auto-generated)
  - userId, message, createdAt
```

## Firebase Configuration
Update the Firebase configuration in `src/lib/firebase.ts` with your actual Firebase project credentials:

```javascript
const firebaseConfig = {
  apiKey: "your-api-key",
  authDomain: "your-project.firebaseapp.com",
  projectId: "your-project-id",
  storageBucket: "your-project.firebasestorage.app",
  messagingSenderId: "your-sender-id",
  appId: "your-app-id"
};
```

## Security Rules (Firestore)
You'll need to set up Firestore security rules in the Firebase Console to match the previous RLS policies.

## Next Steps
1. Create a Firebase project
2. Update the configuration with your project credentials
3. Set up Firestore security rules
4. Enable Authentication providers
5. Test all functionality

## Removed Features
- Database initialization (not needed with Firebase)
- Supabase-specific real-time wrapper
- PostgreSQL-specific queries and operations
